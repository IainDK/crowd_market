## CrowdMarket

CrowdMarket is a group project that was built during my time at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/career-support/). It is an e-Commerce/Social Media hybrid.

## Technology Used

This project uses Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, RSpec, Capybara, HTML, CSS and BootStrap.

## Functionality & Features

Upon registering, the site allows users to make regular social media posts, which can be commented on and reacted to. The difference here is that people can also register as a 'seller' allowing them to sell whatever item they wish. Once a seller has listed a product for sale, it can then be tagged in social media posts. If a user hovers over the item, they can then click on it, which will redirect them to the seller's shop, where they can purchase the item.
